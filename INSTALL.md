# Installing PySwip

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or later
* SWI-Prolog 8.4.2 or later
* 64bit Intel or ARM processor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the SWI-Prolog architecture is the same as the Python architecture.
> If you are using a 64bit build of Python, use a 64bit build of SWI-Prolog, etc.

## Installing on All Platforms

PySwip is available to install from [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pyswip/).

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend installing PySwip into a Python virtual environment.
> See: [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.orgs/3/library/venv.html)

You can install PySwip using:
```
pip install pyswip
```

You will need to have SWI-Prolog installed on your system.
Some operating systems have packages for SWI-Prolog.
Otherwise, you can download it from [SWI-Prolog's website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) or build from source.

PySwip requires the location of the `libswpl` shared library and also the SWI-Prolog home directory.
In many cases, PySwip can find the shared library and the home directory automatically.
Otherwise, you can use the following environment variables:
* `SWI_HOME_DIR` - The SWI-Prolog home directory.
* `LIBSWIPL_PATH` - The location of the `libswipl` shared library.

You can get the locations mentioned above using the following commands:
```
swipl --dump-runtime-variables
```

That will output something like:
```
PLBASE="/home/yuce/swipl-9.3.8/lib/swipl";
...
PLLIBDIR="/home/yuce/swipl-9.3.8/lib/swipl/lib/x86_64-linux";
```
Use the value in the `PLBASE` variable as the value for the `SWI_HOME_DIR` environment variable.
Use the value in the `PLLIBDIR` variable as the value for the `LIBSWIPL_PATH` environment variable.
