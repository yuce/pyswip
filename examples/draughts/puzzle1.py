# "Twelve draught pieces are arranged in a square frame with four on
# each side.  Try placing them so there are 5 on each side.  (Kordemsky)
#
# "Maybe this problem is not described very well but I wanted to stick
# with the original text from Kordemsky.  The problem may be stated in
# terms of guards on the wall of a square fort.  If a guard stands on a
# side wall then he may only watch that particular wall whereas a guard
# at a corner may watch two walls.  If twelve guards are positioned such
# that there are two on each side wall and one at each corner then there
# are four guards watching each wall.  How can they be rearranged such
# that there are five watching each wall?"
